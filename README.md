## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- **Order confirmation text mismatch:**  
  If you see an error about `"THANK YOU FOR YOUR ORDER"` vs `"Thank you for your order!"`, update your test to match the actual text (case and punctuation matter).

- **Checkout with empty cart:**  
  The Sauce Demo site allows proceeding to checkout with an empty cart. Your test should expect navigation to `/checkout-step-one.html`.

- **Playwright browsers not installed:**  
  If you see browser errors, make sure you ran `npx playwright install`.
